0. This code is to be tested on Ubuntu 14.04, 64-bit image with Linux kernel version 3.13.0-24
1. User needs to have root privileges to use the filesystem. Log in as root and execute the following steps
2. Replace <Mount Directory> with the absolute path of the desired mount point directory while executing step 4. Do not create the <Mount Directory> just mention the fully qualified path
3. Execute dos2unix initScript.sh (If dos2unix is not installed on the image execute apt-get install dos2unix)
4. Execute chmod +x initScript.sh
5. Execute ./initScript.sh <Mount Directory>
6. The filesystem will now be mounted at the specified directory
7. Go to the directory used to mount  the filesystem for testing the filesystem flows. Some of the commands supported by filesystem are echo, touch, mkdir, rmdir, rm -rf, cat, cd, pwd, ls, df
